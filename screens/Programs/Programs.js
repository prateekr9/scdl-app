It is a systematic process that involves analysing learner profiles and training needs, organising information according to established standards and creating learning plans and content to achieve specific goals. Traditional training methodology focuses on a predominantly one-way transfer of information. The theories of instructional design, however, focus on a resultoriented learning approach in which the users are able to achieve specific goals in a given environment. It is primarily used to develop computer based and web-based content. PGDID program provides basic theoretical and practical skills needed to design, deliver and evaluate courseware. Students explore the theories of Instructional Design through reading, viewing e-learning modules and practical applications. The program aims at acquisition of professional qualification in Instructional Design as well as self-enrichment and improvement of job-related skills.",
