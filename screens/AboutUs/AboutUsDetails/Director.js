          Global boundaries are vanishing, merging people of diverse cultures,
          nationalities and age groups. Education is emerging as the most
          powerful platform in the ' boundary less' world. Distance learning
          opens new dimensions of opportunities for students to obtain higher
          education without the constraint of location and time. Symbiosis
          Centre for Distance Learning (SCDL) offers a chance to enhance your
          career and life through the medium of quality education.
